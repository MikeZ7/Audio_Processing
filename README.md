# Audio Processing Project

This project purpouse is to gather and use make use of some Digital Signal Processing theorems
and functionalities I've learned through academic DSP course.

## **Waveform generator**

Written using pyqt5 library GUI to plot prime signal in time and frequency domain. Generator implements also FFT and IFFT calculation. as well as saving/uploading signal to/from .wav file.

## **Future Updates**

* Spectrogram plotting
* Microphone recorder
* Matching microphone recorded sound with database samples using OpenCV
